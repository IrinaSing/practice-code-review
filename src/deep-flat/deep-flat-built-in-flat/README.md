# Deep-flat: use a built-in array method

<!-- BEGIN DOCS -->

<a name="deepFlat"></a>

## deepFlat â‡’ <code>Array</code>

Converts a nested array into a single array with no nesting.
Flattens array with any depth.
Returns a new array and there are no side-effects.

**Returns**: <code>Array</code> - - The new flattened array.

| Param   | Type               | Default         | Description           |
| ------- | ------------------ | --------------- | --------------------- |
| [array] | <code>Array</code> | <code>[]</code> | The array to flatten. |

**Example**

```js
deepFlat([1, [2, [3, [4]], 5]]);
// -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

**Example**

```js
deepFlat(["a", ["b", [["c"], ["d"]], "e"]]);
// -> ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
```

## Strategy

To use a built-in array method that flattens array of any depth. It's a short solution of the challenge.

---

## Implementation

- Create a new array to avoid side-effects.
- Use `Array.flat()` method to flatten the old array. As far as we want to flatten array
  of any depth, we specify 'Infinity' as a parameter.
- Assign result to the newArray.
- Return the new array.

---

## Use Cases

```js
const forBob = [["bananas", "melon"], ["tea"]];
const forJane = [["tomatoes", "cucumber"], ["cola"], ["snack"]];
const forMary = [["milk"], ["apples"]];
const shopList = [forBob, forJane, forMary];

console.log(deepFlat(shopList)); // ["bananas", "melon", "tea", "tomatoes", "cucumber", "cola", "snack", "milk", "apples"]
```
